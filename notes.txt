While tackling some corner cases, we found that, for a given action, summing 2 mills together resulted in poorer AI behavior. However, summing 2 partial mills resulted in much better performance. Intuitively, this makes sense, as you want to set up more possibilities of future mills than closing 2 opportunities at once, unless that is the only option to mill.

example case:

0     0     y
  -   -   1    
	1 1 -    
0 - -   - - 0
	- - 1
  -   1   -  
x     -     0

for player 0, putting their piece in position x is better than y.
